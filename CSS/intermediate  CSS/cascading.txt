so basically cascading happens based on Four different parameters those are 

1. position : This typically means If the same kind of CSS styling is there 
each after another line, then the last line will get the most importance

2. specificity : So specificity means that if we are defining a particular
element, be it a list element,by its ID, by its class, and also by its 
attribute.then the most specifying one would be its ID, because ID for each 
element is unique. Then its attribute. If we have added an attribute draggable 
to that particular element, then that is the second most prioritized 
specification for that particular element. Then we have the classes, then 
the.element type, or the element name, like list or paragraph tag.

3. type : inline style > internal style > external style

4. importance : 

#link{
    color : red ;
}

#link {
    color : red !important ;
}
